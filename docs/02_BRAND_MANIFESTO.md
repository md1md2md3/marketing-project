# BRAND IDENTITY: AURA

**Name:** AURA
**Slogan:** "Sentient Living."
**Core Philosophy:** Technology for Humanity (Marketing 5.0).

## The Mission

To move beyond the "Internet of Things" to the "Internet of Behavior." We do not sell hardware; we sell peace of mind, energy efficiency, and seamless living. We use data-driven empathy to create homes that think.

## The Justification (For the Report)

1.  **Data-Driven Empathy:** We use sensors to predict human needs (Harmony Pillar), aligning with the Marketing 5.0 focus on predictive context.
2.  **Societal Impact:** We dedicate a full pillar to Sustainability (Source) and reward energy efficiency with "Green Points."
3.  **The Privacy Paradox:** We sell a specific service ("The Invisible Boundary") to secure customer data, building trust in an era of surveillance.
