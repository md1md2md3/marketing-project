Here is your updated, all-inclusive AURA Project Master Document.

This document contains everything we have created during this session: the strategy, the exact text for the site, the site structure, the AI prompts, and the Marketing 5.0 justification for your report.

PROJECT MASTER DOSSIER: AURA
Status: Ready for Build Platform: Wix Core Philosophy: Marketing 5.0 (Technology for Humanity)

1. Brand Identity
   Brand Name: AURA

Slogan: "Sentient Living."

Mission Statement: To move beyond the "Internet of Things" to the "Internet of Behavior." We do not sell hardware; we sell outcomes—Peace, Comfort, and Freedom. We use data-driven empathy to create homes that think.

2. The 5 Ecosystem Pillars (Product Strategy)
   Instead of generic categories, we use 5 "Living Layers" to organize the hardware.

1. NEXUS (The Foundation)
   Role: Connectivity & Intelligence.

The Emotional Benefit: Reliability. The nervous system that ensures the home never "loses its mind."

Color Code: Cyan / Electric Blue.

Tagline: "The Nervous System."

Visual: Abstract fiber optics, mesh network nodes.

2. SANCTUARY (Security)
   Role: Protection & Safety.

The Emotional Benefit: Peace. It’s not about fear; it’s about the deep sleep that comes from knowing you are safe.

Color Code: Deep Blue / Purple.

Tagline: "The Guardian."

Visual: Sleeping baby, peaceful night exterior, shield icon.

3. HARMONY (Comfort & Atmosphere)
   Role: Lighting, Climate & Audio.

The Emotional Benefit: Empathy. The home anticipates your mood—warming the lights and cooling the air before you ask.

Color Code: Warm Amber / Orange.

Tagline: "The Caretaker."

Visual: Cozy couple on sofa, warm reading nook, soft gradient light.

4. FLOW (Access Control)
   Role: Locks, Doorbells & Intercoms.

The Emotional Benefit: Freedom. Frictionless movement. The house recognizes you and welcomes you in without keys.

Color Code: Silver / White.

Tagline: "The Open Arms."

Visual: Woman entering smiling, open door, bright daylight.

5. SOURCE (Sustainability)
   Role: Solar, Battery & Monitoring.

The Emotional Benefit: Resilience. Independence from the grid. The home is a creator of energy, not just a consumer.

Color Code: Vibrant Green.

Tagline: "The Heartbeat."

Visual: Solar panels, green leaf tech, sunlight.

Manifesto Strip: Text block explaining "Technology for Humanity."

The Interactive Diagram: The "Ghost Button" section.

Center: AURA UNIFIED (Link to Whole Home Kit).

Orbit: 5 Nodes linking to the 5 Collection pages.

Services Teaser: "Don't Buy Products. Buy Outcomes." Links to Bookings.

Layout: Zig-Zag Strip Layout (Image Left/Text Right, then swap).

Products: High-ticket bundles (e.g., "The Sanctuary Starter Pack") rather than single items.

5. The "AURA Unified" Diagram Logic
   Used for the interactive homepage element.

Geometry: One large central node surrounded by 5 smaller nodes in a pentagon (clock face) arrangement.

Central Node: "AURA UNIFIED". Represents the AI brain that integrates all data.

Outer Nodes: The 5 Pillars feeding data into the center.

Implementation: Background Image + Transparent "Ghost Buttons" grouped together for mobile responsiveness.

6. Marketing 5.0 Justification (For the Report)
   Copy-paste these points into your written report to explain WHY you built the site this way.

Data-Driven Empathy: "We moved away from technical specs (megapixels) to human benefits (peace of mind), aligning with the Marketing 5.0 focus on the 'Internet of Behavior'."

The "Source" Pillar (Sustainability): "By dedicating a full pillar to renewable energy (Source) and rewarding it with 'Green Points', we address the societal impact requirement of Marketing 5.0."

The "Invisible Boundary" Service (Ethics): "We address the 'Privacy Paradox' by offering a paid service specifically designed to limit data collection, building consumer trust in an era of surveillance."

The Ecosystem Approach: "The 'AURA Unified' diagram demonstrates that value comes from the integration of technologies (Next-Tech), not the devices themselves."

7. AI Image Prompts Repository
   Use these to generate the assets for the site.

One large central node reading 'AURA UNIFIED' surrounded by exactly five smaller orbiting nodes arranged in a pentagon shape. Colors: Cyan, Purple, Amber, White, Green. Style: High-tech blueprint aesthetic, bioluminescent glow, 8k resolution."

Prompt 2: The Hero Image (Homepage Top)

"A wide-angle landscape hero image. Subject: A sprawling, ultra-modern architectural villa at night, rendered as a glowing bioluminescent blueprint projection. Inside, a network of connecting data streams weaves between invisible devices. Colors: Deep blacks, electric blue lines, amber and green accents. Style: Cinematic, futuristic holographic rendering."
